# soccer-stats

A Clojure project which pulls in club positions of soccerclubs of the last 10 years and calculates the (weighted) average position.
Might come in handy when doing predictions :)

## Usage

Do your own predictions by writing your data to the text file which can be found in the resources directory.

## Todo

- Take degradation into account (adding last position+1 ?)
- Show variation per club (in addition to average)
- improve weighted positions function ... map over scores per year ... combined with for expression?

## License

Do whatever you like with the code on your own risk.
